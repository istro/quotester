quickie rails app just to refresh my memory.

Intended to store inspirational quotes, organized in groups, accessible via json api.

`GET /api/any_active`  will give you a random quote from all active groups.
`GET /api/group_random?group_name=group_name`  will give you a random quote from a `group_name` group.
